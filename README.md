## Overview

Welcome to the Spam and Ham Detection project, dedicated to creating an effective solution for classifying incoming messages or emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). Our mission is to help users filter out unwanted or potentially harmful messages with precision.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Classification**: Our system employs advanced text classification techniques to accurately categorize messages as spam or ham.

- **Customization**: Tailor the classification model to your specific requirements, selecting from a range of machine learning algorithms.

- **Training and Evaluation**: Comprehensive guidance on training the model and assessing its performance is provided.

- **Data Preprocessing**: We include essential data preprocessing steps such as tokenization, stemming, and feature extraction to enhance classification accuracy.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Spam and Ham Detection system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. **Training**: Prepare your training dataset and update configuration settings accordingly. Execute the training script using `python train.py`.

4. **Testing**: Test the trained model on new data with `python test.py`.
